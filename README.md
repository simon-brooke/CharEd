CharEd is a character editor for the animated 3-D models used with[the jMonkeyEngine (JME) game engine][jme]. It is forked from Stephen Gold's [Maud](https://github.com/stephengold/Maud) character editor, and retains the BSD licence which he used, rather than the GPL I would normally use.

I have renamed the project because my intention for it is different from his. If you want something you can use quickly, you should start from Maud, rather than from here.

My intentions for this are

1. It should support development of the [simulated-genetics](https://github.com/simon-brooke/simulated-genetics) system I'm currently working on;
2. In the longer term, it should be a reasonably reskinable character editor that people can integrate into their own game projects. 

In short: do not use this (at least yet). Maud is a better foundation for anything you are building.
